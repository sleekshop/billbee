# billbee
Billbee connector - app

This piece of code is in beta stage.

The "GetOrders" request is implemented and works fine with billbee.

To get this piece up and running:
1.) Copy the whole code into a public accessible directory on your server.
2.) Create the application in your sleekshop backend.
3.) Put in the application_token in the app which will prompt you to do this
4.) Also fill in the api_endpoint, licence_username and the licence_password which you get also from your backend in the administration section.
5.) The code generates an Application Key which you need to place in your billbee backend with the link to the billbee_api.php file which you have uploaded.
